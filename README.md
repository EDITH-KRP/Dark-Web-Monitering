# Dark Web Monitoring Tool

This project is a comprehensive Dark Web monitoring solution designed to crawl .onion websites, attempt IP and geolocation reveals, filter dark web sites based on keywords and risk scores, and track seller profiles. The tool includes both backend (Python) and frontend (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript) components.

## Features

- **Tor Crawling**: Crawl `.onion` websites on the Dark Web using the Tor network.
- **IP and Geolocation Reveal**: Attempt to reveal the true IP and geolocation of Dark Web sites.
- **Keyword and Risk Filtering**: Filter sites based on predefined keywords like "drugs", "murder", "arms", etc., and calculate a risk score.
- **Seller Tracking**: Track seller profiles and activities on Dark Web marketplaces.
- **VPN Support**: Mask IPs and prevent tracking using VPN connections.
- **Web Archive Proxy**: View old versions of websites using web archive proxies.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of Dark Web for illegal activities.
- **Geolocation Identification**: Identify geographic locations associated with Dark Web sites.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Tor Browser (for crawling `.onion` sites)
- VPN (for IP masking)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Install Backend Dependencies

1. Navigate to the `backend/` folder.
2. Install required Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install Frontend Dependencies

1. The frontend uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so no installation is necessary for frontend libraries.

### VPN Setup

Ensure that your system has an active VPN connection to mask your IP while crawling the Dark Web.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dark-web-monitoring-tool.git
cd dark-web-monitoring-tool
```

2. Run Tor on your machine. It should be running on port `9050` (default setting).

3. Update the `vpn_connect.py` script to connect your VPN if necessary.

## Usage

### Running the Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend/` folder.
2. Start the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the backend API on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Running the Frontend

1. Open the `frontend/index.html` file in a browser to view the monitoring dashboard.

2. The frontend will communicate with the backend API to display the crawled data, filtered results, IP details, and seller profiles.

### Example:

1. **Scraping a `.onion` site**: The backend will scrape Dark Web sites using Tor and display the content.

2. **Tracking Sellers**: Input the seller's profile URL in the frontend, and the system will display seller activities.

3. **Viewing IP Details**: You can reveal the IP and geolocation of any `.onion` site.

## Backend Structure

The backend is built with Flask and Python. Here's a brief overview of the structure:

```
backend/
├── app.py                # Main entry point for Flask app
├── crawler.py            # Handles crawling and scraping of .onion sites using Tor
├── vpn_connect.py        # Manages VPN connection for IP masking
├── utils.py              # Helper functions like IP reveal, geolocation, etc.
├── data_storage/         # Folder for storing crawled data
│   └── crawled_data.json # The JSON file containing the crawled data
└── requirements.txt      # Backend dependencies
```

### **Key Scripts in Backend:**

- **`app.py`**: Main Flask application that exposes API endpoints.
- **`crawler.py`**: Handles crawling of `.onion` websites via Tor.
- **`vpn_connect.py`**: Connects and handles VPN settings for IP masking.
- **`utils.py`**: Utility functions like IP reveal, geolocation, and data filtering.

## Frontend Structure

The frontend consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that handle the UI and interact with the backend API.

```
frontend/
├── index.html                    # Main HTML page
├── styles.css                    # CSS file for styling the UI
├── script.js                     # JavaScript file to handle dynamic actions (UI, data display)
├── dark-mode-toggle.js           # JavaScript file to handle Dark/Light mode toggle
├── filter.js                     # JavaScript file for handling data filtering (keywords, geolocation)
├── ip-details.js                 # JavaScript file to handle IP reveal data (for Dark Web sites)
└── assets/                       # Folder for images/icons (e.g., country flags, icons)
    ├── flag-icons/               # Country flags (for fake geolocation)
    └── logo.png                  # Project logo or any relevant images
```

### **Key Files in Frontend:**

- **`index.html`**: The main page displaying the monitoring dashboard.
- **`styles.css`**: CSS file for the layout and styling of the dashboard.
- **`script.js`**: Handles UI interactivity, including making API calls to the backend.
- **`dark-mode-toggle.js`**: Toggles between light and dark themes.
- **`filter.js`**: Filters crawled data based on user-specified criteria.
- **`ip-details.js`**: Manages the IP and geolocation reveal feature.

## Dark Web Scripts

The `dark-web-scripts/` folder contains scripts responsible for Dark Web crawling, IP reveal, filtering sites, and seller tracking.

```
dark-web-scripts/
├── tor_crawler.py                # Crawls .onion sites using Tor
├── ip_reveal.py                  # Attempts IP reveal and geolocation of Dark Web sites
├── dark_web_filters.py           # Filters sites based on keywords and risk score
└── seller_tracking.py            # Tracks seller profiles on Dark Web marketplaces
```

### **Key Scripts in Dark Web Scripts:**

- **`tor_crawler.py`**: Crawls .onion sites and retrieves their content using the Tor network.
- **`ip_reveal.py`**: Attempts to identify the IP address and geolocation of a Dark Web site.
- **`dark_web_filters.py`**: Filters and rates Dark Web sites based on certain keywords and risk thresholds.
- **`seller_tracking.py`**: Tracks Dark Web sellers by scraping their profiles and activities.

## Dependencies

- **Backend:**
  - Flask
  - Requests
  - Stem (for Tor control)
  - BeautifulSoup (for scraping)
  - Geopy (for IP geolocation)

To install the backend dependencies, run the following:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- **Frontend:**
  - No additional dependencies are required for the frontend since it's built using plain HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
